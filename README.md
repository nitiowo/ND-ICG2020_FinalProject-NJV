Repo for final project

Team: Nitin Vincent

New code required:

Activities required: Comparing caddisfly transcriptome to an outgroup such as Lepidoptera, figure out which set of transcripts are responsible for sodium channel function.

Data Used: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA436868

Question asked: Is is possible to isolate sodium channel genes from transcriptome data for caddisflies? Is there a strong signature of selection for these genes?
